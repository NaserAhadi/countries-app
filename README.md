## Brief Explanation About Project
-> In this project I used Nuxt.js framework and Vuetify UI component.

-> I did my best to write clean code and also I created design system which contains base component.

-> I registered base components locally where I needed them and it is better for performance.

-> I didn't use any global style and each component contains own styles so the styles are loaded whenever they're really needed.

-> Project is responsive for mobile and desktop mode in demanded width and it has dark mode which user can toggle between dark mode and light mode.

-> Some base component has unit test but there wasn't enough time to write more unit test.

-> Api services are based on repository service pattern.
